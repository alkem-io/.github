# Alkemio Contributor License Agreement

Alkemio (formerly Alkemio) uses the CLA-Assistant automation to ensure contributers formally agree with the contents of the ALkemio Contributer License Agreement ("CLA")

This automation makes use of a Github Gist to store the CLA, which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ReneHonig/db1f2493e947ccf813a4172a86a49b05#file-cherrytwist_cla).
