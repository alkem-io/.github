## Welcome to Alkemio! - _a new way of working on challenges, together_
Many Challenges in society and organizations are hard to solve. From refugee crises to climate change to a digitalizing society to community initiatives. People want to engage in effective and meaningful ways - _but how?_

Alkemio makes it easy to manage Challenges and have contributors, from anywhere, working together on solutions. Challenges take center-stage. Focus is on the destination.

Backed by a foundation to develop the Alkemio platform and community of people, companies, NGOs and public bodies. Purpose driven, with a hugely ambitious agenda.

Connect, collaborate and contribute!
